By Weng Fei Fung. Budget Tracker lets you record your expenses and deposits so you can track your budget anywhere you are. Even if you are traveling to a remote area where internet is spotty, the app remembers your offline records and updates as soon as the internet is connected. You can install the PWA and have easy access from your mobile's home screen.

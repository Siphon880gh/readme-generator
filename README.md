Installation
---
Clone repository. Install inquirer. Run index.js: `node index.js`.

Install Alias
---
If you are on Linux or Mac, I recommend installing an alias "readme-gen" so you can easily open the ReadMe generator and create a README.md on the spot. Adjust the paths as necessarily, namely where your .bash_profile would be, and the path to where you cloned this repository. Keep the repository on your computer for the alias to work.
```
echo 'alias readme-gen="cd /Users/<Username>/readme-generator; node index.js;"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

You'll be in the cloned repository folder. Run `open .`. Then copy `Generated-README.md` to where you need it.

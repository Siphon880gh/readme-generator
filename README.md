Installation
---
Clone repository. Install inquirer. Run index.js: `node index.js`.

Install Alias
---
If you are on Linux or Mac, I recommend installing an alias "readme-gen" so you can easily open the ReadMe generator and create a README.md on the spot. 

Adjust the paths as necessarily, namely where your .bash_profile would be, and the path to where you cloned this repository. Keep the repository on your computer for the alias to work.
```
echo 'alias readme-gen="cd /Users/<Username>/readme-generator; node index.js;"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

You'll be in the cloned repository folder. Run `open .`. Then copy `Generated-README.md` to where you need it.

Color Coded
----
Questions are color coded to help you decide how the ReadMe will look:
- Green Background: Basic questions that should be answered for people to understand your app. For example, repository name and description.
- Yellow Text: Questions about you that will appear at the bottom as a side note.
- Gray Text: Completely optional badges, demo, video, or screenshot meant to capture people's attention and convert to using your app. Badges can also serve as portals to your other portfolio, social medias, funding links, and can show stats about your repository.
- Green Text: Other questions such as installations, usage, license, contribution guidelines, and test instructions.
